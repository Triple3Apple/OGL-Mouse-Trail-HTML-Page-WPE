# OGL-Mouse-Trail-HTML-Page
 WPE (Wallpaper Engine) Files for the OGL-Mouse-Trail-HTML-Page wallpaper

Made this repo for myself so I can recall how the heck I made the last wallpaper and maybe help out a few other souls who are also lost trying to make a web wallpaper.

For more information and credits regarding this wallpaper, check out this repo I made that does not work with WPE but on browsers:
